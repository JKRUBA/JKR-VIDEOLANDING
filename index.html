        <h1>The Proud Rose</h1><div class="image-container">
            <img src="rose.jpg">
        </div>
        <p id="para1">Once upon a time, there lived a rose flower that was incredibly proud of it’s beautiful looks. The only disappointment the rose had was that it grew alongside an ugly cactus.
            Every day, the rose would be ready with an insult that it would pour upon the cactus for his looks, but the cactus would remain silent and not react. No matter how hard every other plant in the garden tried to make the flower understand and discourage it from insulting the cactus, the rose was adamant and swayed by her good looks.
            One day, a pine tree,  growing next to the blossomed rose said that it wished it was a beautiful flower and hoped it could also be as appealing one day. Another tree said to the pine tree that there was no need to be sad as no one can have everything. Hearing the conversation, the rose replied to the trees and that it seemed like she was the most beautiful flower in the whole forest.
            Listening this, the sunflower raised its yellow head and said, “Why do you say that? In the whole forest, there are many beautiful flowers, and you are just one of them.” To this, the rose replied that it saw everyone looking at her and admiring her. The next moment, the rose used her cunning wit by humiliating the cactus by calling it ugly and full of thorns. The other trees quickly replied that this was shameful talk by the rose as no one can decide what exactly is beautiful, and the rose flower itself had so many thorns.
            As the days passed by, the rose looked at the cactus and continued insulting him. The cactus never replied or  even got upset and instead, advised the rose that God did not create any form of life without a purpose.
            Spring passed by and the weather turned hot. Life in the forest became difficult without the rain. The rose began to wilt.
            One day the rose saw a sparrow stick it’s beak into the cactus and fly away. The rose was amazed by this and asked the pine tree what the sparrow was doing? The pine tree replied that the bird was getting water from the cactus, which was hurting the cactus due to the holes created inside it, but it could not see the bird suffer, and therefore, it was helping them.
            The rose felt ashamed to ask the cactus for water. But finally, when she did ask for help, the cactus kindly agreed. The sparrows filled their beaks with water and watered the roses’ roots.</p>

        <h1>The Lion And The Elephant</h1><div class="image-container1">
            <img src="ele.jpg"></div>
        <p id="para2">Once upon a time, there were two creatures who were mortal enemies. 
            The Lion and the Elephant. The Lion was the ruler of the jungle, with the ability to do anything he wanted.
            The Lion would not invite the Elephant to any meetings because he despised it. 
            When it was time to work, the Lion would always assign the elephant the most difficult task, which was always exhausting. 
            Despite Lion's grief and loathing for the Elephant, the Elephant remained patient and loyal to the Lion.
            When Lion's Cub was in the jungle one day, a large tree fell on it by mistake. 
            The Cub couldn't hoist it over himself since it was too heavy. 
            So the Cub began yelling for aid, and when the other animals heard him, they immediately rushed to assist him.
            Many animals attempted to raise the tree, but it was extremely heavy, and the Cub was on the verge of death. 
            Fortunately, an elephant arrived and, upon seeing what was going on, felt empathy for the Lion's Cub. 
            Despite their animosity, the Elephant chose to pull the tree off the Cub and save its life.
            As a result, when the Lion learned that the Elephant had saved his son's life, he was overjoyed and grateful for the elephant.
            The Lion begged the Elephant's forgiveness, and the Lion promptly selected the Elephant as Prime Minister of the Jungle, and the two became fast friends.</p>
